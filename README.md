**Website Behavior**<br>
When the links in the navbar are clicked, the user is taken to those sections of the website. When the user clicks the 'Resume' link, they are taken to a pdf of my resume. The project images are linked, as well as the project title. When these links are clicked, the user is taken to the application page in a separate tab. The github repos are also linked.

In the footer, my LinkedIn and Github profiles are linked, as well as my email and phone number.
